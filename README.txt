1) To run this code please do the following:
	0- This project uses Visual Studio! Please download visual studio to view this assignment if you don't already have it.
	1- Download the repository locally.
	2- Open up the Project1 folder which contains the C++ assignment files.
	3- Click on Project1.sln - ideally, this will open in a current version of Visual Studio.
		3.1- Alternatively, I believe opening Project1.vcxproj works as well
	4- Make sure main.cpp is open
	5- At the top of the screen, click debug > start without debugging
	6- The console will have everything you need to finish testing the code, enjoy!
